# Scrapy-Django-NewsScraper
Using Scrapy to read information off of web page and populate it in Django Database

Worked to connect scrapy to a Database on Django. Current fields only take headline of news and link to the news. Using UUID to identify each news in unique way so search with complexity of O(1) will be achieved. 

Scrapy crawl achieves database population right now.
